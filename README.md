# SNMP Integration (`snmp_r3d3`)

A **custom Home Assistant integration** that provides monitoring and control of SNMP-enabled network devices such as managed switches, routers, and other infrastructure.  
This integration is fully GUI-driven (no YAML configuration required) and supports **SNMP v1, v2c, and v3** with vendor-specific OID profiles.

---

## ✨ Features

- **GUI configuration only** – no YAML editing required.
- **SNMP protocol support**:
  - v1 / v2c (community strings)
  - v3 (user-based, with authentication and privacy protocols)
- **Polling & update cycle**:
  - Configurable polling interval for sensors
  - Independent update cycle for MAC address tables
  - Slow-cycle updates for static attributes (firmware, model, serial, etc.)
- **Entity types supported**:
  - Sensors (numeric, text, data rate, counters with `diff` calculation)
  - Binary Sensors (on/off states with custom value maps)
  - Switches (device-wide and per-port control, including PoE control)
  - Text entities (readable and writable values via SNMP SET)
- **Per-port monitoring**:
  - Port admin/oper status
  - Traffic in/out (with diff calculation)
  - Port errors (input/output counters)
  - Port speed and name/alias
- **PoE support**:
  - Device PoE budget and usage
  - Per-port PoE enable/disable switches
  - Per-port PoE power and status
- **MAC address tracking**:
  - Global MAC collection switch
  - Per-port MAC collection switches
  - Normalized MAC table entities
- **Vendor device profiles included**:
  - **Generic MIB-II** (basic SNMP support)
  - **Zyxel GS1920 series**
  - **Ubiquiti EdgeRouter**
  - Easy to extend with new devices by adding Python files in `devices/`

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Copy the `snmp_r3d3` folder into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:
   ```
   custom_components/snmp_r3d3/
   ```
   so that the path is:
   ```
   <config>/custom_components/snmp_r3d3/manifest.json
   ```

2. Restart Home Assistant.

3. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.

4. Search for **SNMP Integration (snmp_r3d3)** and follow the wizard.

---

## 🧭 Configuration Flow

The integration is set up entirely via the **Home Assistant GUI**:

1. **Basic Info**  
   - Device IP  
   - Device name (friendly name)  
   - Device type (select from vendor profiles) : files in /devices
   - Entity prefix (used for unique entity IDs)

2. **Settings**  
   - SNMP version (v1, v2c, v3)  
   - Polling interval (seconds)  
   - MAC update cycle (multiplier of polling interval)  
   - Enable controls (if disabled, switch/text entities fall back to read-only)  
   - Custom OIDs (optional `name:oid` pairs, comma-separated)

3. **Credentials**  
   - v1/v2c: Read community, optional write community  
   - v3: Username, authentication protocol/key, privacy protocol/key  

4. **Connection Test**  
   - Validates SNMP connectivity with the device using `access_test_oid`.  
   - If controls are enabled, performs a read/write/reset test.

5. **Discovery**  
   - Queries device OIDs for model, serial, firmware, port count, PoE capabilities, etc.

6. **Config Parsing**  
   - Builds entity definitions for attributes, device sensors, and per-port sensors.

7. **OID Validation**  
   - Confirms which OIDs are valid on the device.  
   - Skips unsupported OIDs automatically.

8. **Entity Presentation**  
   - Shows discovered entities grouped by type before final confirmation.

9. **Finish**  
   - Integration is installed and entities are created.  

Reconfigure or delete is available from the integration’s options menu.

## 🛠️ Adding Vendor Profiles

To add support for a new device:

1. Create a new file in `custom_components/snmp_r3d3/devices/` named after the device (e.g. `cisco_ios.py`).  
2. Define the required dictionaries: `config`, `attributes`, `device`, and optionally `ports`.  
3. Restart Home Assistant and the new device type will appear in the configuration wizard.
